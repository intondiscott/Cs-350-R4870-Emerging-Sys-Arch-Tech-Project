<h3>Q: Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In this project, I needed to handle multiple interrupts from button presses to printing serial information. The device must be able to handle various events without pausing making sequences smooth. This project demonstrates my understanding of using state machines to handle interrupts and how different protocols work together for communication from software to hardware.</p>
<h3>Q: What did you do particularly well?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Writing clean and efficient code that helped with readability and performance.</p>
<h3>Q: Where could you improve?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Outside the scope of the class, I want to better understand driver signing and making drivers.</p>
<h3>Q: What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The biggest tool for me is reading the datasheets of the hardware I am using.</p>
<h3>Q: What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong>The skills learned in this class overall are transferrable in many software engineering projects such as unit testing and modularity.</p>
<h3>Q: How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I used structs(public classes) with pointers to let the code speak for itself. This kept the code easy to follow.</p>
